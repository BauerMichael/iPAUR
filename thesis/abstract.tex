    We present a comparison of different convex total variation based image processing algorithms and the non-convex Mumford-Shah Functional. We will revisit and make use of the fast primal-dual algorithm of \cite{Pock-et-al-iccv09}. We consider all steps, projections, operators and computations and will give a range of proofs. We also present a various range of applications and compare the presented methods to each other. Providing run-times, used memory and results will lead us to a conclusion which problem fits best to several situations.
